# Deep Learning for Modern Code Review Using Tranformer models

This work focuses on training T5 models to automate three code-review tasks:
- (i) Code-to- Code, where for a given code its expected refined code is generated, 
- (ii) Code-and-Comment-to-Code, where for a given code and review comment, a desired refined code implementing the comment is generated,
- (iii) Code-to-Comment, where for a given code, its anticipated review comment is generated,

  
and understanding and reproducing the results from this [work](https://github.com/RosaliaTufano/code_review_automation) and to see how well the trained models generalize to a new dataset.
